### Day 12: September 9, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I learnt about CSS POsitioning.  
2. Normal document flow.   
3. Floating elements.  
 

**Thoughts**:     
1. `display:inline-block` makes the inline elements like `a or span` to behave like blocks elements like `p or div`.  
2.  `line-height` defines the height of the line in a text, the space between lines.  
3. The `float` property is makes an element to break the normal document flow.  
4. The `margin`, `padding` should be taken cared when we use the `width` and `height`
